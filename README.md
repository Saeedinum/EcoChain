# EcoChain: Interactive Earth Systems Explorer

## About the Challenge

The challenge focuses on the intricate connections between Earth’s systems and the need to effectively communicate these interrelationships to the public. Climate change, droughts, wildfires, and air quality are all interlinked phenomena that significantly impact one another. The objective is to create an interactive audio-visual product that utilizes imagery and data from NASA's Earth-observing satellites to illustrate how changes in one system can affect another. The goal is to raise awareness and promote understanding of these critical environmental issues.

## High-Level Summary
